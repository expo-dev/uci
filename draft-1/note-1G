[En-En] I was thinking more about point 1 as I got around to writing code
related to it, so consider this an addendum. Newlines are the only possible way
to delimit commands (or at least the ones which can use whitespace as a token).
When I wrote point 1, I was thinking there would be some (probably very hacky)
way of delimiting based on how output was flushed alone, but I/O on the OS level
doesn’t remotely work like that. You probably should still aim to send messages
within the same buffer, more for efficiency reasons than anything else, but I
don’t think it’s strictly necessary, considering handling potentially long
option commands would become awkward.
